  Here is a visualization of fireworks using p5.js <br />
        <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="sketch.js"></script>
            <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="firework.js"></script>
            <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="particle.js"></script>
<br />
This simple program made me consider functions, objects, and events that are dependent on each other.
<br />
Also, adding some randomness creates a nice effect.
<br />
Going forward, I would like to learn more HTML and CSS in order to add more interactivity and style.
